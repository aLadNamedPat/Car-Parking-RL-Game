# Car-Parking-RL-Game
Parking Pygame environment converted into gym environment for reinforcement learning training!

The current reward function is somewhat limited and does not train the agent to effectively park. I suspect the issue lies in the fact that agents can earn a tremendous amount of reward in oscilation. Another pet project that I need to come back to.

I would like to re-implement this project in a multi-robot landscape where there are multiple agents attempting parks simultaneously.
