###REWARD FUNCTION PLAN

# Take reward to be the distance from parking spot. Closer the car is to the parking spot, the greater the reward
# This reward could be based on some sort of exponential function with distance as the input
# Make distance intervals when reward is given instead of anything continuous since the rounds are discrete.
